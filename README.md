# net-cat


### Project

This project consists on recreating the **NetCat in a Server-Client Architecture** that can run in a server mode on a specified port listening for incoming connections, and it can be used in client mode, trying to connect to a specified port and transmitting information to the server.

- NetCat, `nc` system command, is a command-line utility that reads and writes data across network connections using TCP or UDP. It is used for anything involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets, it is able to open TCP connections, send UDP packages, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports and many more.

- To see more information about NetCat inspect the manual `man nc`.

The project has the following features :

- TCP connection between server and multiple clients (relation of 1 to many).
- A name requirement to the client.
- Control connections quantity.
- Clients must be able to send messages to the chat.
- Do not broadcast EMPTY messages from a client.
- Messages sent, must be identified by the time that was sent and the user name of who sent the message, example : `[2020-01-20 15:48:41][client.name]:[client.message]`
- If a Client joins the chat, all the previous messages sent to the chat must be uploaded to the new Client.
- If a Client connects to the server, the rest of the Clients must be informed by the server that the Client joined the group.
- If a Client exits the chat, the rest of the Clients must be informed by the server that the Client left.
- All Clients must receive the messages sent by other Clients.
- If a Client leaves the chat, the rest of the Clients must not disconnect.
- If there is no port specified, then set as default the port 8989. Otherwise, program must respond with usage message: `[USAGE]: ./TCPChat $port`

### Usage

```console
$ go run cmd/main.go
Listening on the port :8989
$ go run cmd/main.go 2525
Listening on the port :2525
$ go run cmd/main.go 2525 localhost
[USAGE]: go run cmd/main.go $port
$
```

* You should answer the client with a linux logo and ask for their name, when connection is received

```
$ nc $IP $port
